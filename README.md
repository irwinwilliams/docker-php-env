# A PHP environment in Docker
A quick PHP environment in docker. 
I used this sample as a guide: https://github.com/mrfoh/docker-laravel 
Essentially, I didn't bother with Laravel or MySQL.

To make it work, I copy these files (except the readme) to a folder containing a PHP website in a "./public" folder and then run:

## docker-compose up -d

And access the site on port 8080
